## About the Data

The data used to create the models and do the analysis was taken from a kaggle open dataset called [BRISC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025).

Please, to run the notebooks successfully:

### Download data manually

- Go [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025)
- Press the **download** button
- Unzip it into the project's root, make sure to name the directory as `brisc2025/`.

### Download data using Kaggle CLI

If you have set up the CLI already, run the following command:

```bash
kaggle datasets download briscdataset/brisc2025
```

When you have the data, unzip it into a directory called `data/` inside the project, you can do this using the next command:

```bash
unzip <filename>.zip -d brics2025
```
